# Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Laravel Document Search API Engine to be workspace-aware with project support. The API now provides multi-tenant functionality where each workspace can contain multiple projects, and each project can manage its own collection of documents.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Core Architecture Refactoring
- **Workspace-aware Controllers**: Refactored SearchController, IndexController, and DocumentController to handle workspace context
- **Project Management**: Added complete project CRUD functionality with ProjectController
- **Service Layer**: Updated SearchService and DocumentService to consistently handle workspace and project context
- **Middleware**: Implemented WorkspaceMiddleware for request authentication and workspace resolution

### ✅ Database Schema Updates
- **Workspaces Table**: Created migration and model for workspace management
- **Projects Table**: Added projects with workspace relationship
- **Documents Table**: Updated to include project_id and maintain workspace relationship
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper relationships between all entities

### ✅ API Enhancements
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Complete Swagger annotations for all endpoints
- **Resource Classes**: Created DocumentResource and ProjectResource for consistent API responses
- **Request Validation**: Implemented StoreDocumentRequest and SearchRequest with proper validation rules
- **Route Structure**: Updated routes to follow `/api/workspaces/{workspace}/...` pattern

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Created unit and feature tests covering all major functionality
- **Factory Classes**: WorkspaceFactory, DocumentFactory, and ProjectFactory for test data generation
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Unit tests for DocumentService and SearchService
  - Feature tests for WorkspaceApi and ProjectApi
  - All 41 tests passing with 266 assertions

### ✅ Documentation and User Interface
- **Updated README.md**: Complete documentation of new architecture and API endpoints
- **Architecture Diagram**: Created visual representation of the system structure
- **Test Interface**: Web-based interface at `/test` for API exploration
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI available at `/api/documentation`
